themoviedb demo program
=======================

This program was designed to illustrate some basic Docker functionality.  The
program was written in Java and utilizes [Spring Boot] (http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) and [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/home) technologies.  It includes a MySQL database and utilizes the Movie Database API.

In order to access the Movie Database API (REST service), an environment variable,
MOVIEDB_API_KEY, must be defined.  If an API key is needed, sign up and request
one here: https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api

If you would like to start a project with the same technologies, you might try the [Spring Boot Initializer](https://start.spring.io/) to
get up and running quickly.
