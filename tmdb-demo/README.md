This program was designed to illustrate some basic Docker functionality.  The
program was written in Java and utilizes Spring Boot and Vaadin technologies.  It
includes a MySQL database and utilizes the Movie Database API.

In order to access the Movie Database API (REST service), an environment variable,
MOVIEDB_API_KEY, must be defined.  If an API key is needed, sign up and request
